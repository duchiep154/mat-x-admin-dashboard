Mat-X Admin Dashboard is a Premium Angular Material Admin with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's Material Design. It is based on the popular Angular Material framework and comes packed with multiple third-party plugins. All components are built to fit perfectly with each other, while aligning to the material concepts.



Mat-X Dashboard makes use of light, surface and movement. The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple layers, so that the depth and order is obvious. Inside the archive you will find multiple example pages on how to use all components. And, of course, every element is documented.‚Äã



Mat-X Admin Dashboard has the same line of design as the Mat-X Admin Prod Dashboard Material Kit , so they go together quite good. If you think you will need more landing and example pages, be sure to check it out. If you love material design, you'll probably enjoy using these products!
